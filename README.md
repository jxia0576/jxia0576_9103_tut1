Inspiration: Doctor Strange's Magic Circle Visual Effects

I drew inspiration from Doctor Strange's magic circle visual effects—where intricate geometric lines intertwine with luminous patterns to evoke a potent fusion of technological sophistication and mysticism. I sought to borrow this visual language of symbolic geometry and energy flow for my project, aiming to represent the latent forces within information systems. This approach not only possesses aesthetic appeal but also symbolises the concept of “control and order”.

### Part 2:

```
The sketch by kfahn demonstrates a dynamic line interference (Moiré) and rotational symmetry technique in p5.js. Multiple overlapping lines rotate and shift slightly to generate complex optical patterns and motion. This coding method can help me recreate the glowing, geometric layering seen in my imaging inspiration by building depth and rhythm through repeated transformations. The continuous rotation and transparency effects add a hypnotic sense of energy and movement to the visuals.
